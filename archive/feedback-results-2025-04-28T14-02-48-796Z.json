She is making a tracking tool for knee workouts and has a working backend but the frontend(log in page) was not working consistently. I suggested she get our classmate Gabe to look over it since he had experience with log in pages. I also suggested an AI tool called Glide because Peter has a working log in page and that is the tool he used. They gave me good insight on how I can frame the usefulness of my tool.",
